# Prototype-Owl-Insider

## Description: 
This video presents a prototype that I developed as part of my coursework in MIS 4596, "Information Systems Integration," at Temple University in the fall of 2018. The prototype was crafted utilizing the prototyping software known as "Justinmind." This endeavor was a collaborative initiative, undertaken alongside two fellow classmates. Within this team effort, I held the sole responsibility for the actualization of the prototype. My two colleagues, on the other hand, were tasked with conducting comprehensive research and crafting supplementary business documents that delineated the imperative nature of the proposed project from a business standpoint.
